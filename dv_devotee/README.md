# Dataview For Devoted Learners

This repository is a supplemental resource for [Obsidian](<https://obsidian.md>) users looking to learn the [Dataview](<https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=dataview>) plugin. Explanations of syntax, data types, functions, and recommendations for query structure, both for DQL and DVJS, will be offered. API references will be mixed with Markdown annotations, visual aides, and example queries that operate on an included set of mock files, in order to help motivate the understanding and use of Dataview.

This repository is not directly intended to be used as an Obsidian vault, and is instead meant to be downloaded, either in part or in whole, and included in a user's vault(s) to facilitate ease of access and live experimentation. As such, it does not include a copy of the Dataview plugin, nor any supporting configuration files.

Many of the Markdown files in this repository include helpful [Properties](<https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties>) in a YAML Frontmatter block. These Properties simultaneously allow for Dataview querying, and also allow for improved filtering and searching via Obsidian's core [Search](<https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search>) plugin. Property keys and values will be written with the aim of preventing namespace collisions in user vaults, typically by prefixing with `dvL_` ("Dataview Learners", not "deviL" ðŸ˜‰) when needed.
